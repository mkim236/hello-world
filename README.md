# hello-world
getting started

Hi I am a Taehwa prisoner looking for an exit from this hell.
Only way I can get out is by learning new skills that will equip myself for finding a better job.
I hope I can learn a lot from the Udemy course recommended by Aaron P Tech aka Code Drip the Youtuber.
I want to get out of Taehwa so bad.
